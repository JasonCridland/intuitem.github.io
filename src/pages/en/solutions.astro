            CISO assistant answers the growing pain of any CISO or cybersecurity
            practitioner: where to start with so much data and threats and how
            to reconcile security and compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary challenge is finding an efficient way to handle this
            deluge of information without compromosing the sensitivity or
            privacy of your data. The CISO Assistant streamlines this process by
            organizing, interpreting, and prioritizing the data by leveraging
            our offline and local AI engine. Through its innovative
            capabilities, it allows for the swift identification of potential
            threats, enabling a quick response to mitigate risk.
